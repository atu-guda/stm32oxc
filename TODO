05d - func for EXTI->IRQ, not macro only : func exsist fot f407v:l02_coord
check VBUS_PIN, ID_PIN for usb init + enable it macros?
12b, 12c - common config
H7 - more init MPU? = aux fun for all others?
H5 - check delays + DELAY_APPROX_COEFF
namespace oxc
Returns std::expected / optional?
More ReturnCode usage/expected
Several CmdInfo Arrays + adjusted aliases + search: compile time hash?
Combine DevIn + DevOut? + add flags ? optional buffers?
  { DevOut_FatFS : public DevOut, OutStr: public DevOut }
Check strings in stack: std::inplace_vector<*> -- still not exsist
  or std:array + span to send as params (SmallString replacement or data holder)

RD6006 - retry loop and params
UsartIO - only one ptr hold
Events in main loop
Better split main loop/irq/idle
07b - all arches (need keyboard) - rework with events?
Make common: 60, 61, 62 + config
Modbus client

Check MMU init in H7
test SDcard in blue H7
type info and NamedObj rework
file (DevIO flags)
oxc_gpio.cpp : split f1/other
gpio: init by list
Bug: adcdma_n: limit output to n
ADC_Info: more common / split
F7 DMA:
    The SD card works with DMA when disabling the cache memories in HAL_MspInit();
    The SD card works without DMA when cache memories are enabled;
    Adding SCB_CleanInvalidateDCache() before starting the DMA for reading, and SCB_CleanDCache() before starting the DMA for writing makes the SD card work with DMA and caches.
Fix bug with small floats output
STD_POST_EXEC redesign: weak?
USB CDC: DevIO: hook for connect/disconnect
substitute vars (or by any hook) in cmdline: oxc_console.cpp: exec_direct?
oxc_smallrl: UTF-8 minimal handling
common RCC init Rewrite Sysinit
Fix 51a_adcdma_n ... examples
Fix stemwin (f429_disc)

SmallRl, console: set output funcs to unbind
Move SPI common funcs from 28 to oxc lib
Move ADC common fuctions (some to bsp)

Check MiniStr::operator+=( const char *rhs ) bug with whole string - now masked


New SDIO with DMA.
Fast data communications with computer: USB, ether, WiFi, serial
SPI debug
Cmd buffer alloc - use for data storage (ADC, sensors ... )
I2C, SPI: from buf to device, fill buf.
str2addr: some common addrs: GPIOA.. USARTx, SPIx, I2Cx, ..... (debug only) - combine with substs
1wire return codes test
DAC + DMA
Keepalive LED with more data.
Common graphics tests.
DevIO : public Dev ?
Errno of fd check
F3: OA, ADC
SWO

Move more common code to common dir.

devices:
USB mass storage
USB data streams
CAN
PS/2
DHT11 - humidity
IR ctl recv - RC5,  ...
Color screen
Ether
GPS
MFRX522  - RFID


Test: float, sprintf, queue cost.
 Results:
  queue: =~ size * n + fixed; (RAM)
  float: +3k (FLASH)
  sin: +4k
  sqrt: +0.5;
  arm_sin_f32: up to 2x faster
  printf: +26k
