Use PinOut instead PinsOut in SPI ..., where only one pin is required
Bug: adcdma_n: limit output to n
ADC_Info: more common / split
F7 DMA:
    The SD card works with DMA when disabling the cache memories in HAL_MspInit();
    The SD card works without DMA when cache memories are enabled;
    Adding SCB_CleanInvalidateDCache() before starting the DMA for reading, and SCB_CleanDCache() before starting the DMA for writing makes the SD card work with DMA and caches.
Fix bug with small floats output
STD_POST_EXEC redesing: weak?
USB CDC: DevIO: hook for connect/disconnect
07b - all arches (need keyboard)
substitute vars (or by any hook) in cmdline: oxc_console.cpp: exec_direct?
oxc_smallrl: UTF-8 minimal handling
common RCC init Rewrite Sysinit
Fix 51a_adcdma_n ... examples
Fix stemwin (f429_disc)

SmallRl, console: set output funcs to unbind
Move SPI common funcs from 28 to oxc lib
Move ADC common fuctions (some to bsp)

pkgconfig for OXC?
Check MiniStr::operator+=( const char *rhs ) bug with whole string - now masked


New SDIO with DMA.
Fast data communications with computer: USB, ether, WiFi, serial
SPI debug
Cmd buffer alloc - use for data storage (ADC, sensors ... )
I2C, SPI: from buf to device, fill buf.
str2addr: some common addrs: GPIOA.. USARTx, SPIx, I2Cx, ..... (debug only) - combine with substs
1wire return codes test
DAC + DMA
Keepalive LED with more data.
Common graphics tests.
DevIO : public Dev ?
Errno of fd check
F3: OA, ADC
SWO

Move more common code to common dir.

devices:
USB mass storage
USB data streams
CAN
PS/2
DHT11 - humidity
IR ctl recv - RC5,  ...
Color screen
Ether
GPS
MFRX522  - RFID


Test: float, sprintf, queue cost.
 Results:
  queue: =~ size * n + fixed; (RAM)
  float: +3k (FLASH)
  sin: +4k
  sqrt: +0.5;
  arm_sin_f32: up to 2x faster
  printf: +26k
